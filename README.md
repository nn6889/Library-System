# Faculty Research Database Project
## Background:
Faculty and students engage in research and publish their results, but it is difficult to keep track of what each faculty and student has been researching on. A database application will help address the problem and keep all work in a database so it is easy for users to navigate through.

### Functionalities
#### Faculty
 - Has the ability to insert, update and delete their entries
#### Students and Public
 -  Has the ability to search and view entries for collaboration
